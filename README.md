# tinyApp

an app exclusively written in HTML, CSS and JS, no libraries!

as an exercise, this single page website will only use vanilla JS, HTML and CSS

the goals are to develop: 
1. a calculator
2. a note application
3. a game
4. an art work
5. a shopping interface

navigated to on a SINGLE PAGE, no redirection/reloading

Once the framework is to a point that it can be deployed,  the next step will be to host the app as an extension on my personal portfolio, Stomski.com


## Overall Structure:

so it seems to me that the easiest way to manage the single page, modular app interface will be to build seperate `<sections>` that will seperate each of the above 5 goal sections, 

and then a script or CSS that cycles through the sections?

what displays as the title on the tab? preferably the tool im using but lets be honest its not gonna start that way
