### general structuring

goals for the day:

1. build the html, 
2. original css 
3. import a script
4. begin the calculator
5. REACH GOAL: I want to render a canvas on the page, im excited about the art stuff


### running notes:
git repo built, docs started

html started! hello world, push to git

worked on the HTML docs, going to start with at least my first page, the calculator, and my second page, my canvas, as sections in the HTML

the dream here is a sort of carousel like effect for the single page app

So the switching engine is working great, and the scripting for the calculator is very stragiht forward, it isnt using processing power as it attempts to render, but the art render DOES take a lot of compute power and i only want the framecount to be running when someone is looking at the canvas, if it is rendered on the page.
