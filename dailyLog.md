goals for the day:

1. build the html, 
2. original css 
3. import a script
4. begin the calculator
5. REACH GOAL: I want to render a canvas on the page, im excited about the art stuff


### running notes:
git repo built, docs started

html started! hello world, push to git

worked on the HTML docs, going to start with at least my first page, the calculator, and my second page, my canvas, as sections in the HTML

the dream here is a sort of carousel like effect for the single page app
